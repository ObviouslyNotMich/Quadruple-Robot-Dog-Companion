# Quadruple Robot Dog Companion

## Project Overview
The **Quadruple Robot Dog Companion** project integrates advanced robotics and AI technologies to create an intelligent robotic companion capable of real-time interaction and navigation. Built using **ROS (Robot Operating System)** and **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**, the robot combines voice and vision mapping to understand and respond to its environment.

### Key Features:
- **AI-Driven Voice & Vision Mapping:** Utilized ROS and NVIDIA Jetson Nano for seamless integration of voice and vision-based control.
- **Real-Time Object Detection & Speech Recognition:** Implemented using **C++** and **Python**.
- **Optimized Locomotion Algorithms:** Enhanced stability and movement efficiency through fine-tuned locomotion algorithms.
